## Higher Order Components

I like calling them HOCs for short. Pronounced HOK because spelling out three letters is excruciating.

Higher Order Components are useful when you wish to implement common functionality among components, or when you see certain implementation details as a necessary _abstraction_.



I remember being slightly confused when I first read about _Higher Order Components_, because they sounded eerily similar to _Higher Order Functions._ Higher order functions are functions that accepts functions as arguments or returns a function as a result.



If you would like a deeper dive into HOCs, read this excellent post [http://rea.tech/reactjs-real-world-examples-of-higher-order-components/](http://rea.tech/reactjs-real-world-examples-of-higher-order-components/ "Real World Examples of Higher Order Components") by my mate @mehdimollaverdi.



## Functions as Child Components

I wrote this [http://rea.tech/functions-as-child-components-and-higher-order-components/](http://rea.tech/functions-as-child-components-and-higher-order-components/ "Functions as Child Components and Higher Order Components") a while back. Still am a massive fan.
